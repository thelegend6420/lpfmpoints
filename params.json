This time series intends to display how the change in policies have allowed more Low Power FM stations to be established. Additional projects were developed in conjunction with this one:\r\n\r\n* [LPFM Opportunities Spatial Analysis repo][lpfmrepo] \r\n* [LPFM Opportunities Map][lpfmmap]\r\n* [LPFM Channel finder API][api]\r\n  \r\n## Data\r\n  \r\n  * Data are stored in [a cartoDB table][cartodb] \r\n  * data directory also contains a copy of the source data in GeoJSON format (WGS 84) lpfm_points.geojson \r\n  \r\n## Inspiration\r\n  \r\nInspiration for this visualization comes from the Guardian UKâ€™s [First World War Ship Movements][guk] and the good folks at [cartoDB][cdb] and their torque project. \r\n  \r\n  [ghp]:http://fcc.github.com/lpfmpoints/lpfmpoint.html \r\n  [lpfm]: http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/low-power-fm-broadcast-radio-stations-lpfm \r\n  [lpfmrepo]: https://github.com/thelegend6420/lpfmpoints\r\n  [lpfmmap]: http://www.fcc.gov/maps/low_power_fm_opportunities_wo_2nd\r\n  [api]: http://www.fcc.gov/developers/lpfm-api\r\n  [cartodb]: https://fcc.cartodb.com/tables/lpfm_point/public\r\n  [guk]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/oct/01/first-world-war-royal-navy-ships-mapped \r\n  [cdb]: http://cartodb.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
